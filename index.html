<p style="font-family:calibri; font-size: 14pt;align: justify;">Currently, I am a fellow at the Insight Data Science Program. For my Insight project, I consulted with a subscription e-commerce startup to develop a <span style="font-weight:bold">forecasting model for the demand</span> of their products. The forecasting algorithm takes as input customer transaction data, models the seasonality, growth, churn, and probability of demand for two different types of customers, and provides predictions for the demand of 24 products up to two months in the future. The mean weighted error was estimated at 6.7% using a training set from August 2014 to August 2015 and a testing set from September 2015. The dataset is stored in a PostgreSQL database and for the analysis I used Python, Pandas, NumPy and SciPy.<br>

<p style="font-family: calibri; font-size: 16pt; font-weight:bold;align: justify;">Research</p>

<p style="font-family:calibri; font-size: 14pt;align: justify;">My research area is Solar Physics. I use <span style="font-weight:bold">machine learning methods to predict solar storms</span>, such as flares and coronal mass ejections. This is an unbalanced classification problem since solar eruptions are rare events and only a small percentage of the dataset contains observations of the positive class. My work involves developing Python code for data cleaning, feature extraction, and feature engineering, implementation of feature selection and appropriate validation methods for unbalanced datasets, and optimization and hyperparameter tuning of machine learning algorithms. Most of my work is done with supervised learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks. I presented the results of my work in August 2015 at the <a href="http://astronomy2015.org/">XXIX International Astronomical Union (IAU) General Assembly</a> in Hawaii, which was the largest astronomy conference ever held.<br>

<p style="font-family:calibri; font-size: 14pt;align: justify;">As a PhD student, I used <span style="font-weight:bold">helioseismic methods to investigate the interior of the Sun</span>. I designed and implemented noise reduction methods based on computation of billions of cross correlations, and detected for first time emerging sunspots beneath the solar surface. The results of this work were published in Science magazine and generated media coverage in over 50 media outlets, including <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/25aug_sunspotbreakthrough/">NASA Science News</a>.

<p style="font-family: calibri; font-size: 16pt; font-weight:bold;align: justify;">Side Projects</p>

<p style="font-family:calibri; font-size: 14pt;align: justify;">Last summer I participated at the 
<span style="font-weight:bold">Kaggle Caterpillar Tube Pricing competition</span>. The goal of this 
project is to develop a machine learning model and predict the price of industrial tube assemblies. 
The dataset is comprised of 21 relational tables. I merged all the tables into one large dataframe 
and I used imputation techniques to replace missing values. I also used advanced feature engineering 
methods to create new features with high predictive value. Then, I implemented feature selection 
methods based on feature correlations and feature importances (computed with a Random Forest 
Regressor) to reduce the number of features from 300 to about 60. Finally, I computed a blend of 
Gradient Boosting models using the XGBoost library and Bagging. My best submission achieved a 
score of about 0.2125 on the private leaderboard and was ranked in the top 3% among more than 
1300 teams. A more detailed summary of my approach as well as my code are posted in 
my <a href="https://github.com/cedar10b/Caterpillar-Tube-Pricing">Github page.</a><br>

<p style="font-family:calibri; font-size: 14pt;align: justify;">Recently, I also developed a <span style="font-weight:bold">customized recommendation system for traveling</span>. This application takes as input the user's preferences for airfare, weather, safety, dining and nightlife, and recommends travel destinations using Yelp, QPX, and Weather Underground APIs as well as city crime data. A more detailed description of the application as well as the Python code are posted in my <a href="https://github.com/cedar10b/travelapp">Github page.</a><br>
